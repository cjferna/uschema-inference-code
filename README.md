# U-Schema Inference from Code Process
Inference process to extract U-Schema models from application code

This repository contains the projects involved in extracting the schema of a javascript application which uses mongodb database and create a U-Schema model from it. 

The inference processes depend on the U-Schema core projects that are found in the corresponding [U-Schema repository](https://github.com/modelum/uschema).

$ git clone https://github.com/modelum/uschema
